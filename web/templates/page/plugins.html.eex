<h3>A note about the functionality of the plugins</h3>

<p>
  The plugins work by listening to your editor's text changes and detecting the syntax used. If you are having problems with XP registering to the wrong language, you may need to install an appropriate language support package for your editor. <%= get_conf(:site_name) %> relies on the editor to detect the proper language.
</p>

<p>
  Note that <em>at no point is any of your code sent to <%= get_conf(:site_name) %></em>. Only the amounts of XP (roughly the amount of keystrokes) are sent. For further information, check the <a href="<%= page_path(@conn, :api_docs) %>">API documentation</a> and the source code of the plugins.
</p>

<h3>Atom</h3>

<p>
  To install, use Atom's builtin package search to search for <code>code-stats-atom</code> and install the package. Then go to the package's settings page and insert the API key of the machine you want.

<h3>IntelliJ IDEA / JetBrains IDEs</h3>

<p>
  To install, use the IDEs builtin package manager, click on "Browse repositoriesâ€¦" and search for <code>Code::Stats</code>. After installation, go to Settings -> Other Settings -> Code::Stats and insert your API key.
</p>

  <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8393?pr=">Link to the plugin on JetBrain's site.</a>
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Note:</strong>
  If the plugin fails to send XP, reporting <code>C::S ERR!</code>, hover over the status bar text to see the actual exception. If it complains of a PKIX error, you may need to install the <a href="https://www.identrust.com/certificates/trustid/root-download-x3.html">DST Root CA X3</a> to the IDE's JRE's trust store manually. The command to do that goes roughly like this on OS X:
</p>

<pre>
<code>$ cd /Applications/&lt;IDE&gt;.app/Contents/jre/jdk/Contents/Home/jre
$ bin/keytool -import -alias 'DST Root CA X3' -keystore lib/security/cacerts -trustcacerts -file /path/to/dst_root_ca_x3.pem</code>
</pre>

<h3>Other editors</h3>

<p>
  If there is no plugin for your favourite editor, you can check out the <a href="<%= page_path(@conn, :api_docs) %>">API docs</a> and implement one yourself.

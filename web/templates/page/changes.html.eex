<h2>Changelog</h2>

<h3>1.6.1 â€“ 2016-08-06 â€“ Fixes to machines and page permissions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Forbid authenticated users from accessing the login, signup and password reset pages. They will be redirected to their profile instead.</li>
  <li>Fix crash when machine was deleted, caused by the cache not being regenerated. Now the cache is regenerated automatically after delete and crash is avoided even if regeneration is still in progress.</li>
  <li>Add a JavaScript confirmation prompt when deleting a machine.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1.6.0 â€“ 2016-08-04 â€“ Password resets and fixes</h3>

  <li>Updated privacy policy and terms of service due to email sending feature.</li>
  <li>Fixed ðŸ’¥ when forms like the signup form were filled with invalid data.</li>
  <li>Fixed crash when pulses were sent before caches were generated.</li>
  <li>Fixed crash when pulses were sent with the API token in an invalid format.</li>
  <li>Added Twitter link.</li>
  <li>Added Elixir and Phoenix link to footer.</li>
  <li>Fixed discrepancies in the API docs regarding pulse dates.</li>
  <li>An issue with the "last coded at" date in 1.5.0 was hotfixed.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1.5.0 â€“ 2016-07-17 â€“ Second performance update</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Earlier, profile view XPs per language were cached to the database as CachedXP elements. This worked fine for that purpose but caching for other dimensions such as per machine and per date were needed. In this update, CachedXP is removed in favor of a JSON field on the user model, which can be used to add all kinds of different caches. Caching is implemented in this field for languages, machines and dates. This removes the need to hit the database for other uses than to update the cache and to load the last 12 hours' XP data. As a result the profile view's display should be much faster.</li>
  <li>An issue with 1.4.0 and database limits in queries was hotfixed.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1.4.0 â€“ 2016-07-16 â€“ First performance update</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Total XP and most popular languages counters on the front page are now in-memory, stored inside ETS. They are updated on every incoming pulse (for now) and totally refreshed every 15 minutes. This should make the front page much faster.</li>
  <li>Added an index to make "XP in last 12 hours" queries faster both on front page and profile pages.</li>
  <li>Accessibility was improved with regards to dates and progress bars.</li>
  <li>Fixed average XP per day display, which showed XP in scientific format in some cases.</li>
  <li>Added real page titles for better SEO and bookmarking.</li>
  <li>Updated the codebase for Elixir 1.3, Phoenix 1.2 and Ecto 2.0.</li>
  <li>Fixed some JSON errors not being sent correctly in the API.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1.3.7 â€“ 2016-06-08 â€“ Fix username uniqueness</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Fix username uniqueness, due to a problem with SQL migrations a unique index was not created and multiple users could be registered with the same username. ðŸ˜±</li>
  <li>Change some IDs to bigint because if it's worth doing, it's worth overdoing.</li>
  <li>Remove old unused total XP property from users.</li>
  <li>Clarified git repo licences a bit.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1.3.3â€“1.3.6 â€“ 2016-06-07 â€“ JetBrains and username path fixes</h3>
